Question: How would we go about setting up the trade info?
1. We'd need to query the position we currently are in wrt the configured position.
2. Then we'd need to look at if there are any open stop orders at the position where we would want them for that pair
3. If there are stops in the wrong place or of the wrong size, we need to close them.
4. We need to open a position at the point we need it. 

Question: What happens if we have a partially filled stop order?
* Is the order now above the price (guess that would be a given)
* What if it was partially filled? Do we just wait? 
* Should we panic sell the whole thing? 
* Should we alert the client? 
* How would the client respond? Market sell / wait?
